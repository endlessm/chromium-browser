# CIPD manifest for Windows tools.
#
# We must install anything that we want included on PATH to a different
# subdirectory than Git, as Git's msys bash strips its root directory
# from PATH, hence the subdirs.
#
# If any paths or package layouts change, updates will be required in
# "win_tools.bat" and "win_tools.py" templates.
#
# "win_tools.bat" has a hard requirement that the Python package contains the
# string "cpython" and ends with the CIPD tag "version:VERSION". It uses this
# to extract VERSION.

@Subdir python
infra/python/cpython/${platform} version:2.7.13.chromium7
